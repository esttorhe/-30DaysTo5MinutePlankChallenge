# #30DaysTo5MinutePlankChallenge
30 days to achieve a 5 minute plank

## What now?
There's a challenge going on here or there that «explains» how to achieve a 5 minute plank in just 30 days.

Trying to reach my fitness goal from [this post][resolutions] I'm doing the [#21DaysChallenge][21days] and now decided to add the plank challenge (later I'll attemp the head stand challenge) to it.

The core of it is explained in this image:

## Progress
Whoever explained the challenge to me did it wrong and told me that you were supposed you start at *30s* instead of *20s* so bear with me; is not a typo.
